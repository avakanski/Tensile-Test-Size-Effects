Advancing the understanding of material behavior and phenomena related to size effects in small-scale components is critical for settings where limited quantities of material samples can be tested. Established guidelines for sub-sized specimen testing encompass best practices for specimen preparation, testing equipment, test procedures, and data analysis methods. However, prior investigations of specimen size effects in the literature typically involved a relatively small number of tests performed and analyzed. To address this limitation, our team created a large database of tensile test records for nuclear structural materials collected from peer-reviewed articles. 

In this study, we introduce a machine learning-based approach for predicting key tensile properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation for sub-sized specimens of Stainless Steel 316, and we develop methods for uncertainty quantification of predicted properties. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental validation of the reported critical values for the dimensions and geometry of sub-sized specimens, and we validated existing analytical models for correlating total elongation between sub-sized and standard-sized specimens. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance understanding of specimen size-dependent material behavior and highlight the need for coordinated efforts in developing large, open-source databases of mechanical testing data to support future research.

## üìä Data
 - [**Tensile Properties Dataset**](Tensile_Properties_Data.xlsx): The used dataset in this study is based on the dataset of tensile properties created by our team ([link1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04329-2), [link2](https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:ws-8j)), comprising 1,050 tensile test records of sub-sized Stainless Steel 316 specimens collected from the published literature. Each record includes 55 features covering material type, specimen geometry, heat treatment, testing conditions, and measured mechanical properties. In this work, we expanded the dataset by adding tensile test records for full-sized Stainless Steel 316 specimens, bringing the total number to 1,473 records.

## üß† Machine Learning Methods
We developed machine learning models to predict tensile properties of Stainless Steel 316 specimens, including yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, uniform elongation, and total elongation. In addition to single-point predictions, we implemented uncertainty-aware models to estimate confidence intervals, enabling a more robust understanding of prediction reliability. The following table summarizes the model types and specific algorithms used in this study.
